Definitions:

HEADER:
Commented lines and RULEs at the beginning of the file. Ends when the first section starts.

(In the future we may wish to define this only as the initial comments, but for now it includes loose RULEs, with or without comments.)

SECTION:
Convention for grouping rules about the same plugin
	format:
	1. comment-char-only line
	2. comment-chars followed by whitespace followed by @ symbol followed by some text
	3. comments, whitespace, or RULEs
	4. ends at next section start, alas
	
RULE:
Presumably well-defined by MLOX's parser; it may be useful to accept both
	format:
	[RULE]
	rulestuff

	and
	format:
	;rulecomment with no empty lines after it
	[RULE]
	rulestuff
